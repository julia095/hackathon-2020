# applitools-2020
Applitools Holiday Shopping Hackathon

## The Project

Imagine you are an engineer assigned to test a retail application, AppliFashion, before the busy holiday season.
The challenge is to complete three (3) automated tasks.  For each task, use Applitools Eyes as verification tool.

* Automate the tests below against the V1 production version of this application. Set Eyes to run each of the three tests on Chrome (1200 x 800) using Applitools Ultrafast Grid. 
  * Main page - Check the main page of the app by using Applitools Eyes to take a screenshot of the entire page.
  * Filtered Product Grid - On the left side of the main page, check Black under the colors filter and click the Filter button.Use Applitools Eyesâ€™ Check Region feature to only capture a screenshot of the shoes grid (id=product_grid) and verify that only two black shoes appear.
  * Product Details - Without filtering, click on the Appli Air x Night shoe Use Applitools to take a screenshot of the entire page to verify all of the details about the product.
* Run the same tests against the dev-branch version, which contains bugs.  
* Run your tests again in the final production version of the app but first update your configurations to set Eyes to run each of the three tests across the following configurations using Applitools Ultrafast Grid:
  * Chrome (1200 x 800)
  * Firefox (1200 x 800)
  * Edge Chromium (1200 x 800)
  * Safari (1200 x 800)
  * iPhone X

### Tools
* [Testcafe](https://testcafe-discuss.devexpress.com/) (Note: while working on tests implementation, has found a known testcafe issue which was causing Applitools to not capture a screen correctly. Therefore, I had to downgrade to testcafe@1.8.8 until the issue is resolved)
